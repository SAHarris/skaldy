summary: "If you are using a browser-based AI, you aren't the customer; your intellectual property is the raw material. It is time to close the breach."

## THE CLOUD IS A LIABILITY

Every time a professional pastes a legal brief, a proprietary CNC toolpath, or a sensitive piece of code into a public AI, a trade secret dies. You are paying "Big AI" for the privilege of training your competitors' next model on your hard-earned data. 

At **Skaldy LLC**, we define **Sovereign Intelligence** as the absolute ownership of the machine, the model, and the data. This isn't just a tech stack; it is a fortress.

## 1. AHI: AUGMENTED HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
The industry standard is "Artificial Intelligence"—a black box designed to replace the expert. We reject this. We build for **AHI: Augmented Human Intelligence**. 

The **Sovereign AHI** philosophy places the human firmly in the loop. 
* **The Expert is the Core:** AI should function as a high-performance extension of your own expertise, not a generic substitute.
* **Contextual Lockdown:** Your local AI is tuned to your specific environment—your CNC shop, your engineering firm, your creative studio—without ever phoning home.

## 2. LOCAL AI & THE VULKAN EDGE
True sovereignty requires local silicon. By leveraging optimized local inference engines like `llama.cpp` and high-performance hardware, we deliver compute power that resides within your physical walls.

* **Zero Latency:** Stop waiting for a server in Virginia to "think." Process data at the speed of your own hardware.
* **Performance Ownership:** We utilize high-performance compute infrastructure, including ARM64 based GB10s (the "Hot New") and X86-based systems, to ensure your intelligence is always "Operational".

## 3. AIR GAPPING: THE ULTIMATE HARDENING
For the most sensitive operations, connectivity is a vulnerability. 
* **Physical Isolation:** We specialize in air-gapped deployments where the AI has zero physical path to the internet.
* **Zero Leakage:** In an air-gapped environment, data leakage is mathematically impossible. Your IP stays on your drive, in your room, under your lock and key.

## THE MISSION
Based in **Wichita, Kansas**, Skaldy is building the infrastructure for the era of private, high-performance data processing. Your competition is paying for "AI experts" to manage their cloud dependencies. You should be owning your intelligence.

**STATUS: OPERATIONAL** **ENCRYPTION: AES-256** **LOCATION: ICT-KS**
